    A total of 45 adult Long Evans rats were used in this study. Five were used for the hippocampal and lateral septal 
    in vivo recordings26. Ten rats were used for chronic electrophysiological recordings paired with glucose 
    monitoring. Eight rats were used for optogenetic induction of SPW-Rs and glucose monitoring. Six rats were used for 
    the DREADD experiment, and seven rats were used as controls for this experiment. Three additional rats were used 
    for simultaneous dorsal and ventral hippocampus recordings. Six additional rats were used for the posterior 
    parietal cortex (PPC) optogenetic stimulation control experiments. Sample sizes were selected to match cohort 
    sizes where applicable.

        Recordings were conducted using the Intan RHD2000 interface board, sampled at 20 kHz. Amplification and 
        digitization were done on the head stage. Data were visualized with Neurosuite software. All 
        local field potential (LFP) analyses (ripple detection, state scoring and so on) were conducted on 
        the 1,250-Hz down-sampled signal.
