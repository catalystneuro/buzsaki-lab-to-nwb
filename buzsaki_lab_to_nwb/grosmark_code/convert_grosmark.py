"recordings performed on four male Long-Evans rats in the Buzsáki lab at NYU. These recordings were "
"performed to assess the effect of novel spatial learning on hippocampal CA1 neural firing and LFP "
"patterns in naïve animals. Each session consisted of a long (~4 hour) PRE rest/sleep epoch home-cage "
"recordings performed in a familiar room, followed by a Novel MAZE running epoch (~45 minutes) in which "
"the animals were transferred to a novel room, and water-rewarded to run on a novel maze. These mazes "
"were either A) a wooden 1.6m linear platform, B) a wooden 1m diameter circular platform or C) a 2m "
"metal linear platform. Animals were rewarded either at both ends of the linear platform, or at a "
"predetermined location on the circular platform. The animal was gently encouraged to run "
"unidirectionally on the circular platform. After the MAZE epochs the animals were transferred back "
"to their home-cage in the familiar room where a long (~4 hour) POST rest/sleep was recorded. All eight "
"sessions were concatenated from the PRE, MAZE, and POST recording epochs. In addition to hippocampal "
"electrophysiological recordings, neck EMG and head-mounted accelerometer signals were recorded, and the "
"animal’s position during MAZE running epochs was tracked via head-mounted LEDs."
