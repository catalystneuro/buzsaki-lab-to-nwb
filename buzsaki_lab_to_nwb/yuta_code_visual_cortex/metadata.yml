  session_description:
    The relationship between mesoscopic local field potentials (LFPs) and single-neuron firing in the multi-layered 
    neocortex is poorly understood. Simultaneous recordings from all layers in the primary visual cortex (V1) of the 
    behaving mouse revealed functionally defined layers in V1. The depth of maximum spike power and sink-source 
    distributions of LFPs provided consistent laminar landmarks across animals. Coherence of gamma oscillations 
    (30–100 Hz) and spike-LFP coupling identified six physiological layers and further sublayers. Firing rates, 
    burstiness, and other electrophysiological features of neurons displayed unique layer and brain state dependence.
    Spike transmission strength from layer 2/3 cells to layer 5 pyramidal cells and interneurons was stronger during
    waking compared with non-REM sleep but stronger during non-REM sleep among deep-layer excitatory neurons. A subset 
    of deep-layer neurons was active exclusively in the DOWN state of non-REM sleep. These results bridge mesoscopic 
    LFPs and single-neuron interactions with laminar structure in V1. Subjects were between 3 and 8 months of age.
