  session_description:
    The incorporation of new information into the hippocampal network is likely to be constrained by its
    innate architecture and internally generated activity patterns. However, the origin, organization and 
    consequences of such patterns remain poorly understood. In the present study we show that hippocampal 
    network dynamics are affected by sequential neurogenesis. We birthdated CA1 pyramidal neurons with in utero 
    electroporation over 4 embryonic days, encompassing the peak of hippocampal neurogenesis,
    and compared their functional features in freely moving adult mice. 
    Neurons of the same birthdate displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states and assembly dynamics. 
    Same-birthdate neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations, which were maintained across different environments.
    Overall, the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination of birthdate and the 
    rate of neurogenesis. These observations demonstrate that sequential neurogenesis during embryonic development 
    shapes the preconfigured forms of adult network dynamics.
