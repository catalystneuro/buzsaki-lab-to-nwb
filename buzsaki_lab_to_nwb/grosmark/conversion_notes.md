# Notes on GrosmarkAD of buzsaki-lab-to-nwb data mapping
## Open questions for Ben or Peter are in straight braces []
## ToDo list items are in curley braces {}

### NWBFile
datetext information for the session_start_time is in the session_id string.

### Subject
Most information able to be found in the publication and added manually. Male wildtype Long Evans rats between 250-350g.


### Position (processed, not acquisition)
No .whl file is found, at least in the prototype set.
All positional information is contained in a single position.behavior.mat file, unlike the multiple position files that Yuta had.

This .mat file has a single variable named 'position'. This variable is a struct with several relevant fields.
* position.behaviorinfo.MazeType contains the name of the maze used for the experiment, and is used as the name for the position and spatial series.
* position.timestamps contains the timestamps of the positional information. I confirmed manually it is regularly sampled and so only the starting time and rate are used in the SpatialSeries.
* position.samplingRate contains the sampling frequency of the timestamps in Hz.
* position.position contains three fields; x, y, and lin. x and y are the corresponding coordinates of the subject in the maze. All fields are aligned one-to-one with the timestamps. 'lin' is a linearization of the path through the maze for the circular case, defined as starting at the edge of reward area, and increasing clockwise, terminating at the opposing edge of the reward area. It is included as a separate Position/SpatialSeries pair.
 
### Intervals
See "Position" section for details on structure of that file.

position.Epochs contains the names and windows for the experimental eepochs.


### LFP
Standard Neuroscope format for LFP data and waveforms. No reference electrodes used and hence no decomposition series.


### Sorted units
Standard Neuroscope format for sorted spiking units. Cell types and brain region are contained in session_id.CellClass.cellinfo.mat (CellClass.label) and session_id.spikes.cellinfo.mat (spikes.region), respectively.


### Recording information
No .dat files are available in any of the GrosmarkAD set.
.xml contains electrode structure used to create device and electrode groups.
An extra custom column was added for this dataset, indicating if a particular electrode was "bad" in that it was removed from further analysis due to being unstable or low-amplitude.



### Conversion notes

I had to manually delete the Achilles_Default.xml in session 10252013; we only expect to find one properly formatted .xml in the directory.

{If we ever return to this dataset later; TODO: a) include region associated with each electrode, remove that bit from the session description, and b) infer trial windows and reward results based on positional data (nothing included in session folder, but paper mentions water reward and other conditions)}
